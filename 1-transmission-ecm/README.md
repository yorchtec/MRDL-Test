# Transmission ECM
ArduinoUNO ATmega328

## Description
Monitors drivetrain components using an ArduinoUNO board. Calculates RPM of the engine with a hall efect sensor in the engine and a wheel with magnets in the cranchshaft in between the engine and the CVT primary clutch

Other sensors are in scope: gearbox speed and oil temperature, independent front wheels speed, cvt guard air temperature and vibration (Maybe another ecm?)
